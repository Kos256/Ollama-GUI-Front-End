# Ollama GUI Front End - v0.2

## What is this?
I used WPF to make a front-end application for Ollama. It's not too good but, it is what it is ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯. Make sure to **install ollama** before using this application. You can install ollama for windows [here](https://ollama.com/download/OllamaSetup.exe).

## Who's doing what?
Currently I am the only one developing this project :^)
Yogurt has given me a few ideas that i've implemented, but he might start as a fully fledged contributor soon.

## ⚠️ *Please note this is in a heavy alpha state, the base work is barely laid out!* ⚠️
