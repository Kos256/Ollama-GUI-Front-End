# Ollama GUI Front End
## v0.1

I used WPF to make a front-end application for Ollama. It's not too good but, it is what it is ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯. Make sure to **install ollama** before using this application. You can install ollama for windows [here](https://ollama.com/download/OllamaSetup.exe).

Currently I am the only one developing this project :^)

⚠️*Please note this is in a heavy alpha state, the base work is barely laid out!*⚠️
