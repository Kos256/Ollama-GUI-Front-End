# Ollama GUI Front End - v0.2

## What is this?
I used WPF to make a front-end application for Ollama. It's not too good but, it is what it is ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯. 
Make sure to **install ollama** before using this application. You can install ollama for windows [here](https://ollama.com/download/OllamaSetup.exe).

## ⚠️ *Please note this is in a heavy alpha state, the base work is barely laid out!* ⚠️

## upcoming features;
- Proper support for deep thinking models
= Models tab for downloading and browsing ollama's listed models from the app
- Support for vision models and uploading files into the chat
- Multiple saved chats in the app
